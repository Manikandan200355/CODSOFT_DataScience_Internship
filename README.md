# Notebooks Overview

## 1. IMDB Dataset
File: IMDB.ipynb
Dataset: imdb.csv
Description: This notebook provides an analysis of the IMDB dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic visualization to uncover patterns in the data.

## 2. Iris Dataset
File: Iris.ipynb
Dataset: iris.csv
Description: The Iris notebook walks through a classical dataset used in machine learning. The notebook covers data exploration, visualization, and a simple classification model to predict the species of iris flowers.

## 3. Titanic Dataset
File: Titanic.ipynb
Dataset: titanic.csv
Description: This notebook analyzes the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of a basic classification model to predict survival rates.

## Usage
These notebooks are designed for educational purposes. You can modify and extend the analyses provided to suit your learning needs. The code and data can serve as a foundation for more advanced data science projects.
